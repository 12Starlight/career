# **Project Management Methodologies**

## **Waterfall**

<p>The process of building applications in an order flow whereas the first item must
be completed before the next item can be started. The connected sequence of 
completed items will eventually lead to the overall deliverable. Generally
speaking, it is the most preferred way to build physical projectrs. This so that
projects can be easily duplicated over time on an as needed basis.</p>

<p>Problems with this approach are that simple changes can disrupt the flow of tasks
needed to be accomplished. This makes the overall management practice simple, 
but also inflexible.</p>
