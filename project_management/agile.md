# **Project Management Methodologies**

## **Waterfall**

<p>The process of building applications in an order flow whereas the first item must
be completed before the next item can be started. The connected sequence of 
completed items will eventually lead to the overall deliverable. Generally
speaking, it is the most preferred way to build physical projectrs. This so that
projects can be easily duplicated over time on an as needed basis.</p>

<p>Problems with this approach are that simple changes can disrupt the flow of tasks
needed to be accomplished. This makes the overall management practice simple, 
but also inflexible.</p>

&nbsp;

# **Agile Project Management Methodology**
<h2><em>Based on Four Values:</em></h2>

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

&nbsp;

**What do these various agile frameworks have in common?**

&nbsp;

<p style="text-indent:2em">Customer <kbd>determines</kbd> objectives whether they 
are internal or external, allowing the final deliverable to be flexible. Teams work 
in <kbd>cycles</kbd> that are iterative and get evaluated at the end of each cycle. 
Modifications take place at each evaluation based on the demands of the client. 
The most important part of this management processes success is 
<kbd>collaboration</kbd> between stakeholders and team members.</p>

## **Kanban**

<p>Kaban is like Scrum, but is more based on a team's capacity to do work. It was
founded by Toyota in the 1940's which used cards to signal that a team was ready
for more raw materials, showing that team had more capacity to produce</p>

<p>Today this type of management style is better suited for projects that have
steady output. Teams create tasks represented in a visual format, often using
sticky notes and whiteboards (virtually this is also the case), and move the
notes, or tasks based on predetermined stages to represent progress as it happens
and pinpoint roadblocks</p>

&nbsp;

## **Scrum**

<p>Scrum is the most popular bc of it's simplicity to implement. Past problems
that software engineers have struggled with also get solved. These problems
include: <kbd>convoluted development cycles</kbd>, 
<kbd>inflexibility with project plans</kbd>, and 
<kbd>shifting production schedules</kbd>.</p>

<p>This is done by having a Scrum master whose main job is designed to clear
away obsticles in order to work more efficiently. These work periods are called
`sprints,` which last 2 weeks and the team meets daily to discuss progress or 
possible roadblocks that need to be solved. This type of management gives teams 
the ability to build projects fast that can be tested within fairly small teams.</p>

&nbsp;

**How does agile (Kaban / Scrum) differ from waterfall?**

&nbsp;

<p style="text-indent:2em">Scrum and Kaban differ from waterfall in that they
both work with the client in mind, giving the overall workflow more flexibility.
Processes are not as clearly laid out, but overall delivery of the product is more
complete in my opinion bc several iterations and revisions take place before the
product is rolled out. This makes it better in my opinion for software development
projects due to the ever changing demands of a client and their users.</p>
