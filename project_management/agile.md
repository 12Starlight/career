# **Project Management Methodologies**

## **Waterfall**

<p>The process of building applications in an order flow whereas the first item must
be completed before the next item can be started. The connected sequence of 
completed items will eventually lead to the overall deliverable. Generally
speaking, it is the most preferred way to build physical projectrs. This so that
projects can be easily duplicated over time on an as needed basis.</p>

<p>Problems with this approach are that simple changes can disrupt the flow of tasks
needed to be accomplished. This makes the overall management practice simple, 
but also inflexible.</p>

# **Agile Project Management Methodology**
<h2><em>Based on Four Values:</em></h2>

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

**What do these various agile frameworks have in common?**

&nbsp;

<p style="text-indent:2em">Customer <kbd>determines</kbd> objectives whether they 
are internal or external, allowing the final deliverable to be flexible. Teams work 
in <kbd>cycles</kbd> that are iterative and get evaluated at the end of each cycle. 
Modifications take place at each evaluation based on the demands of the client. 
The most important part of this management processes success is 
<kbd>collaboration</kbd> between stakeholders and team members.</p>
