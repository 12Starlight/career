# **Vim Adventures** 🔥😎🎩🥇

Most keymaps copy the vim, so universally it is helpful to learn! 
In the vim terminal, type:

&nbsp;

## **Level 1**

<kbd>h</kbd> ~ Moves left 

<kbd>l</kbd> ~ Moves right

<kbd>j</kbd> ~ Moves down

<kbd>k</kbd> ~ Moves up

Note: Moving up or down to a shorter line moves you to the last column in the
shorter line. But, if you keep moving to a longer line you will end up in the 
same column where you started!

&nbsp;

<kbd>:help</kbd> + <kbd>key_used</kbd> ~ Allows you to learn more about a key
and what it does 😉

Note: VIM `words` are a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a sequence
of puntuation marks, or an <mark style="background-color: #29b6f6">empty line</mark>. Certain keys help you navigate words.
