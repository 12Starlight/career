# **Vim Adventures** ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ©ðŸ¥‡

Most keymaps copy the vim, so universally it is helpful to learn! 
In the vim terminal, type:

&nbsp;

## **Level 1**

<kbd>h</kbd> ~ Moves left 

<kbd>l</kbd> ~ Moves right

<kbd>j</kbd> ~ Moves down

<kbd>k</kbd> ~ Moves up

Note: Moving up or down to a shorter line moves you to the last column in the
shorter line. But, if you keep moving to a longer line you will end up in the 
same column where you started!

&nbsp;

<kbd>:help</kbd> + <kbd>key_used</kbd> ~ Allows you to learn more about a key
and what it does ðŸ˜‰

&nbsp;

## **Level 2**

Note: VIM `words` are a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a sequence
of puntuation marks, or an ðŸ’Ž empty line ðŸ’Ž. Certain keys help you navigate words.

&nbsp;

<kbd>w</kbd> ~ Move [count] words forward, ending at each first character. 
*Position the curser at the beginning of the word.*

Note: [count] means a number could be put in front of the <kbd>w</kbd>, which in 
that case you would move [3] words forward and start on the 4th word. 

&nbsp;

<kbd>e</kbd> ~ Move forward to the end of a word. *Position the curser at the end of
the word.*

Note: [count] <kbd>e</kbd> moves from the begining of a word to the end, then to the
beginning of the next word [2] times. Does not stop in an empty line. 

&nbsp;

<kbd>b</kbd> ~ Move [count] words backwords, ending at each first character. 
*Position the curser at the beginning of the word.*
