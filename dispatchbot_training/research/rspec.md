# **Rspec Ideas**

## **Statement of Work**

The SoW is the document that captures and defines all aspects of your project. You will note the activities, deliverables and the timetable for the project. It is an extremely detailed document as it will lay the groudwork for the project plan.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

In Agile, acceptance criteria refers to a set of predefined requirements that must be met in order to mark a user story complete. Acceptance criteria are also sometimes called the "definition of done" bc they determine the scope and requirement that must be executed by developers to consider the user story finished.
  * Acceptance criteria should be testable ~ They must be easy to test and leave no room for interpretation with a yes/no/pass/fail result.
  * Criteria should be clear and consise ~ Make it simple and straight to the point
  * Everyone must understand your acceptance criteria ~ Take time to make adustments and ask questions until things are clear for everyone.
  * Acceptance criteria should provide user perspective ~ Look at the problem from a customer's point of view using a real user's experience.

It is widely recommended to make writing acceptance criteria a group activity that includes both dev and QA representatives. Involving developers and QA as you define acceptance criteria has several benefits. For one, it gives you another opportunity to communicate with developers about product strategy and vision. Secondly, developers and QA staff can help point out any missing pieces or identify dependencies that may not have been clear before. Finally, these discussions can help you as the product owner better understand what your user stories look like through the eyes of developers. So whenever possible, define `done` together.
