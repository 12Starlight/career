# **02/08/2021 11:30am <br> <br> MC Trip Update Algorithm Review ðŸ”±**

## **Ideas:**

@Josh - Aks @Coop what the difference between the old vs. new API
  * @Coop - ATMS/CTS has a button that imports the data
    * They have all their data using procs and table variables which get passed off to the proc
      * @Josh - This is known as an antipattern in Rails due to the single soure of truth being in the models. Rails way will cause archetcture differences
  * @Coop - Rides get pushed, inserts, and updates, then their algorithm checks different levels to see, if keys are matching
    * import>logisticare>rider_alerts
    * Real one vs. fake one?
    * @Josh - He likes what he saw, but wants to discard some of the functionality, take some of the SQL query and boil that down to acceptance criteria
  * @Coop - If he could build the algorithm again, he would write more regression tests
  * Takes him 15-40 minutes to deploy using Rails
    * 49 clients on ATMS, KADE and others are the bigger ones

@Fox - Logisticare clients are the most important to focus on

Lost @Shane

@Josh - Talked about blob storage taking too long considering fires
  * Wants to go over SQL, then convert it to acceptance criteria

Other guy is Justin

@Josh asked @Fox - Discussed 'canceled' and 'ommitted' issues in the DispatchBot application that need to be addressed
  * CTS has a cancel option in the admin, DispatchBot only has the delete option which is dangerous and needs to be fixed
  * For the canceled status, anything that has been omitted should be canceled

@Josh - Needs to meet with @Coop in order to get the acceptance criteria laid out 
  * Proxy solution 
    * @Coop - @Amanda changed Circulation
  * Next week he wants to discuss how we are building microservices and how the archetcture is built

@Fox - @Coop and @Justin are utilizing shuttlebox

@Coop - Rides come to the proxy, no matter the broker
  * More than transformation of a cononical structure, the billing structure changed

@Josh - Needs weekly meetings with @Coop 

Need cell phones to be able to accept signatures, especially iPhone12

## **Need:**

Nothing at this time!

## **Questions:**

> In terms of Blob storage and converting SQL into acceptance criteria, what did you mean?
>
> **`Answer`**:
>
>         Blobs ~ Storing Logisticare changes in database, then replay over top 
>         of databse, if necessary
>
>         Logisticare has been a mess to deal with
>           â€¢ Wants it to be easier to follow and work with
>           â€¢ Acceptance criteria are the tests

## **Action Items:**

All set for now!
