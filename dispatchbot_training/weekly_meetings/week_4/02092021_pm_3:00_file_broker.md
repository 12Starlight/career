**Ideas**

`@Clay` @Shane @Josh @Addison

Importing trips manually
  * Table helps to reformat
  * Want csv to map correctly with our schema

@Josh - Create a support ticket, put in info about the broker, talk with @Fox about the priority of the ticket
  * Time to complete ticket would be about 2-5 full working days
