## **Questions:**

> Was the problem a timezone issue then, based on @Chad's comment above?
>
> **`Answer`**:
>
>         It was not the keys, but instead the fields were being processed 
>         twice in a different order. Also, state changed in between the two
>         calls

> In terms of code debt, what do you want me to do to help?
>
> **`Answer`**:

>         I do not need to worry about it right now. However, naturally as time
>         passes, the process will take care of it bc I will write code then a
>         spec for that code which will improve spec coverage. This then, will
>         in turn pay back code debt
