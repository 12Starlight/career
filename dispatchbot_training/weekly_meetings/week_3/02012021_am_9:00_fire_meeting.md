**Ideas:**

Keys from production did not match

&nbsp;

**Need:**

[AWS](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2) - Access ✅

[Sentry](Sentry.io) - Access

Sidekick - Access

[app.codeship.com](app.codeship.com) - Access

[Smart JSON editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smart-json-editor/id1268962404?mt=12)

&nbsp;

**Questions:**

> Why could we not find `/app` and how was that related to the mobile app?

&nbsp;

> When @Shane kept referring to 'full pull' what did this mean?

&nbsp;

> When pulling up the JSON what exactly where you looking for besides the names of keys?
