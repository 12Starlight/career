**Ideas:**

Steps to take for a ticket:
  * Understand everything about the ticket
  * Make sure `Acceptable Criteria` is well defined
  * Reproduce the issue
    * Can not reproduce the issue, then focus on research and reaching out
  * Type out use cases in spec file
    * Write tests using them as an outline or sudo code

Focus on what works well

<kbd>cmd + k</kbd> ~ Clears screen

<kbd>cmd + shift + f</kbd> ~ Search entire project

Vim Shorcuts:
  * /[search_item] ~ Searches file and jumps line to searched item

**Need:**

**Questions:**

> How do I get the app running locally in one systematic process?
>
> Answer:
> <kbd>docker-compose up</kbd> ~ Starts docker
>
> <kbd>[docker-compose stop]</kbd> ~ Stops docker and kills all instances
>
> <kbd>rake db:migrate</kbd>
>
> <kbd>rails s</kbd>
>
> Find in the README the section `Admin Panel` ~ Run again when accessing the admin on the back page or after running <kbd>docker-compose stop</kbd>

&nbsp;

**Action Items:**

Add <kbd>cmd + k</kbd> to terminal commands
