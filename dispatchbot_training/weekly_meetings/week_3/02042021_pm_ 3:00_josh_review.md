**Ideas:**

Steps to take for a ticket:
  * Understand everything about the ticket
  * Make sure `Acceptable Criteria` is well defined
  * Reproduce the issue
    * Can not reproduce the issue, then focus on research and reaching out
  * Type out use cases in spec file
    * Write tests using them as an outline or sudo code

Focus on what works well

<kbd>cmd + k</kbd> ~ Clears screen

VSCode / Rubymine Shortcuts:
<kbd>cmd + shift + f</kbd> ~ Search entire project

Vim Shorcuts:
  * /[search_item] ~ Searches file and jumps line to searched item
