**Ideas:**

@Coop, @Fox, @Lib were on call

Problem with `full pull`

@Coop - Updating priority type, provided SQL query

@Shane - Has live support account to import trips using the broker

Went into codebase, logisticare.rb lines 250-350, changed line 300

@Fox - Wants us to push @Chad's code

@Josh - Concurred and added that we should update Logisticare, then circle back and do it right

Commented out lines 299-301
  * The save part
  * Insert still works
